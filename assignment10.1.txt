1)Explain in brief the need of hive:-

Apache Hive supports analysis of large datasets stored in Hadoop's HDFS and compatible file systems. 
It provides an SQL-like query language called HiveQL with schema on read and converts queries to MapReduce and Spark jobs. 
All three execution engines can run in Hadoop YARN. 
To accelerate queries it also provides indexes with bitmap indexes.
Hive supports extending the UDF set to handle use-cases not supported by built-in functions.

2)Is Hive suitable to be used for OLTP systems?Explain in brief:-

Hive does not provide insert and update functions at the row level.
Hence it is not suitable to be used for OLTP systems.

3)What is a metastore in Hive?

All Hive implementations need a metastore service, where it stores metadata. 
It is implemented using tables in a relational database.
It provides clients access to this information using the metastore service API. 
By default it stores meta data in Derby database but we can also store them in MySql,oracle depending upon the system projects.

4)Can we run unix shell commands from hive?Give 5 examples and share the screenshot:-

Yes,we can run unix shell commands from hive by placing the prefix "!" to the unix command.
For example,to run ls in hive shell place prefix "!" before ls like !ls.

5)Hive can process any type of data formats?Explain in brief:-

Hive can process many file formats such as text file, sequence file, RC file, ORC file.
Hive uses different SerDe interface to process such data.
Hive by default handles only structured data.
